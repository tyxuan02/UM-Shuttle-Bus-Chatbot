# Limitations
st.write("\n\n")
st.markdown("""
**Limitation**: Currently, the chatbot is unable to suggest possible routes between two specific bus stops. Instead, it can only provide information about available bus routes based on a single bus stop input. For instance, you can ask: "Which buses go to the KK1 bus stop?".

**Remember**: The chatbot is trained on a limited dataset, so there may be some questions it can't answer accurately. If you have a question that the chatbot can't answer, or if you need more detailed information, we recommend checking the official UM Shuttle Bus service resources. Besides, please ensure the words you use are correct and clear to get the best response from the chatbot.
